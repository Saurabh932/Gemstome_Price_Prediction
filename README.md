# Gemstone Price Prediction

## Project Overview

his project aims to predict the price of gemstones using various machine learning algorithms and operationalizing the model. It aim to predict the price of gemstones based on various factors such as carat, depth, table, dimensions, cut, color, and clarity. By leveraging historical data on gemstone attributes and prices, we can develop machine learning models to accurately predict the price of gemstones, thereby assisting gemstone traders and buyers in making informed decisions.

## Objectives

1. Develop machine learning models to predict gemstone prices based on their attributes.
2. Implement best practices in machine learning operations (MLOps) to ensure the scalability, reproducibility, and reliability of the prediction pipeline.
3. Deploy the trained models to production environments for real-time price predictions.
